# SortingAlgorithmBenchmarks

A GUI application implemented with JavaFX that helps evaluate the runtime performance of different sorting algorithms. Performance is evaluated based on the amount of exchanges required to sort an array.

## Features

Sorting Algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quicksort

## Motivation

This project was implemented to complete a coding challenge from "Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Data Structures, 4th Edition".

## Language
